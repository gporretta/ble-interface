# HM-10 BLE Python Communication

This project allows two-way communication between a computer and an HM-10 Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) module using Python and the `bleak` library. Messages can be sent from the terminal to the HM-10 and received messages from the HM-10 will be displayed in real time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or later
- Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) support on your computer
- HM-10 BLE module (powered and in range)
- Python package: `bleak`
